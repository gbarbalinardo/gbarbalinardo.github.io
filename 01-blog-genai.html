							<p>Recently, I had the privilege of mentoring the GenAI cohort at <a href="https://innovitsf.com/">INNOVIT</a>, a renowned innovation accelerator connecting Italian startups with the dynamic tech scene in Silicon Valley. During our sessions, we delved into the evolving landscape of generative AI, with a particular focus on building multi-agent applications—systems that go beyond simple chatbots to orchestrate and execute complex tasks. As AI continues to mature, these multi-agent frameworks are becoming the backbone of cutting-edge innovations, so let's break down what it takes to build them and why they're so impactful.</p>
						
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Why Multi-Agent Applications?</h2>
						
							<p>We're moving beyond single-purpose chatbots to a world where AI agents can work together to accomplish tasks. Think of it as different parts of a well-oiled machine, each agent doing its bit to create a fully functional application. Whether you're building a chatbot, an autonomous assistant, or a hybrid AI system that connects various tools and data sources, multi-agent applications give you more flexibility and power.</p>
						
							<p>In fact, the growth in the number of multi-agent AI systems is staggering. According to OpenAI, over 3 million GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) have been created since the beginning of 2024. That's a massive shift, with developers increasingly deploying these agents to handle specialized tasks, each contributing to a larger ecosystem.</p>
						
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The Components of a Multi-Agent System</h2>
							<p>So, how does it all come together? Let's break it down into some of the key pieces:</p>

							<p><strong>- Context and Knowledge Storage:</strong> The first step is understanding what kind of context or knowledge the system needs to handle. This involves storing and retrieving data in a structured way. One popular approach is using vector stores to represent and search knowledge. By breaking down information into embeddings (vectors of numbers that represent meaning), we can efficiently retrieve relevant data. For instance, imagine you've uploaded a bunch of PDF documents into the system, and the user asks a question. The system compares that question against stored vectors to find the most relevant information.</p>

							<p><strong>- Dialogue Management:</strong> Once you've got the context sorted out, the next piece is dialogue management. How do you track the conversation with the user? Do you store the entire conversation history like ChatGPT does, or do you work with single interactions? This decision affects how the system interacts with users, and it's a balancing act between memory and performance.</p>

							<p><strong>- Actions and Function Calling:</strong> This is where things get exciting. It's not enough for an AI system to chat with users—it also needs to <em>do</em> things. That's where function calling comes into play. With function calling, the system can connect to APIs and perform actions, whether it's booking a flight, pulling up the weather, or even generating a chart based on user data. It's like giving the AI a set of hands to carry out tasks on command.</p>

							<p><strong>- Performance and Search Optimization:</strong> Optimizing the search function is a crucial part of the multi-agent system. It's all about making sure the system retrieves the best possible answers as quickly as possible. You can improve this through techniques like prompt engineering or using more advanced methods like Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE). HyDE essentially has the AI generate an answer first and then compare it against the stored knowledge, resulting in more accurate responses.</p>

							<p><strong>- Embedding Models and Vector Stores:</strong> Choosing the right embedding model is key. These models transform sentences into vectors, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval. The decision on which model to use depends on various factors, such as the size of the model, memory constraints, and the specific needs of the application. You can serve embeddings using a GPU or CPU, or delegate this task to a third-party solution like OpenAI, depending on your infrastructure requirements and compliance concerns.</p>

						
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Real-World Applications</h2>
						
							<p>During the GenAI cohort, we discussed how multi-agent systems are already being applied in various sectors, from healthcare to e-commerce. For instance, think of a system that helps users book a vacation. One agent could search for flights, while another checks hotel availability, and yet another handles car rentals. All these agents would communicate with each other, sharing relevant data to provide the user with a seamless experience.</p>
						
							<p>Another example is in research and publishing. Imagine a multi-agent system where one agent gathers data from scientific papers, another creates charts, and yet another writes summaries. These agents work together, allowing for faster and more efficient research workflows.</p>
						
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Why Now?</h2>
						
							<p>What makes this moment unique is the convergence of technologies. We now have powerful large language models (LLMs) that can understand natural language and execute complex tasks. At the same time, we're seeing advances in hardware that allow for faster computation and data storage, making multi-agent applications not only possible but practical.</p>
						
							<p>Programs like INNOVIT are at the forefront of this movement, bringing together startups and innovators to explore what's next for AI. The GenAI cohort, in particular, is focused on generative AI applications that push the boundaries of what AI can do. From natural language processing to multi-agent systems, these new AI paradigms are set to transform industries by improving how we interact with technology.</p>
						
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
						
							<p>While multi-agent systems are incredibly powerful, they also come with challenges. One of the biggest hurdles is ensuring that all agents work together smoothly. This requires careful coordination and often involves integrating APIs from various services. Another consideration is performance—larger models with more parameters may offer better results, but they also come with increased computational costs.</p>
						
							<p>Lastly, security and compliance are always concerns, especially when dealing with sensitive data. For example, embedding functions can sometimes be delegated to third-party providers, but this may not be an option for industries that need stricter data privacy measures.</p>
						
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The Future of Multi-Agent Applications</h2>

							<p>Looking ahead, we're only scratching the surface of what multi-agent systems can achieve. With ongoing improvements in both AI and hardware, these systems will become even more integrated into our daily lives. Whether it's streamlining business operations or creating smarter personal assistants, multi-agent applications are set to become a foundational part of the AI ecosystem.</p>
						
							<p>At INNOVIT, the work being done by the GenAI cohort is just the beginning. We're seeing firsthand how multi-agent systems can solve real-world problems, and the potential is immense. As we continue to push the boundaries of AI, expect to see even more innovative applications emerge.</p>
						
							<p>Multi-agent systems are here to stay, and if you're as fascinated by AI as I am, stay tuned for more insights from the cutting edge of generative AI!</p>
